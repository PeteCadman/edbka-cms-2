<li>by organising training whatever the level of experience,</li>
<li>orgainising a programme of indoor meetings in the winter (either in person or on zoom)</li>
<li>practical demonstrations at our apiary in the open season.</li>
<li>providing a platform where beekeepers can meet to discuss, ask questions and follow up their common interest. (through facebook and whatsapp)</li>
</p>
<p>EDBKA is affiliated to the British Beekeepers Association and Dorset County Beekeepers Association. As a Full Member of EDBKA you will be allocated a BBKA membership number and recieve their monthly magazine, Dorset BKA's <em>Honeycraft</em> and our own quarterly newsletter.</p>
<p>We have an apiary at West Moors where we carry out training and demonstrations and where members will have every opportunity to learn or finetune their bee-handling and hive management.</p>
<p>New members will be encouraged to attend our six-week training course (next running in February and March 2023). These classroom sessions are followed by practical bee handling workshops at our apiary. We have a dedicated WhatsApp group for beginners.</p>
<p>The Association possess two honey extractors which members can borrow for a modest charge to enable them to extract their honey crop.</p>
